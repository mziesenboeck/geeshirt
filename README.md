# geeshirtCAS

This is the repo for the CAS data science project of Michael Ziesenb√∂ck.
The structure of the repo follows a reduced version of the Cookiecutter directory strucure. Details can be found here https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/

Until now the repo only contains files from module 2 and some work on classic logistic regression that was done for the assignment for module 1.

It's a journey into a new world! Let's embrace it.
